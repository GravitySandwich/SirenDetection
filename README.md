# SirenDetection
This is a Siren Detection algorithm based on the Teensy 3.6 platform. This is our senior design project.

# Installation
Use Teensyduino to edit and upload the code.

# Usage
Teensyduino is required. The code uses adafruit RGB LEDs for detection alerts.
However, all debugging information is outputted to the serial monitor.
A 3.5mm Lapel or similiar Microphone is required, along with a Teensy 3.6 and a teensy audio shield or audio adapter board.
The microphone in this code is set through the MIC pins on the audio shield. However, line in may be used with a simple code edit.
